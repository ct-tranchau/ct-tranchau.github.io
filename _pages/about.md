## Welcome! I'm Tran N. (Nina) Chau ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. student in **Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology (GBCB)** at **Virginia Tech**. My research focuses on using **artificial intelligence and computational tools** to solve complex problems in **genomics, plant biology, and microbiome analysis.**

My current work involves:
- Developing computational frameworks for cross-species cell type mapping in single-cell transcriptomics.
- Benchmarking single-cell RNA-seq co-expression methods to improve gene regulatory network inference.
- Applying protein language models to accelerate ortholog detection in plant genomics.

Beyond my research, I am passionate about **machine learning, single-cell multi-omics integration, and advancing computational biology methods for broader biological discovery.**
