title: "Cell and nuclear size are associated with chromosomal instability and tumorigenicity in cancer cells that undergo whole genome doubling"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/cell-nuclear-size-wgd-cancer
excerpt: "This study shows that following whole genome doubling (WGD) in cancer cells, variations in cell and nuclear size influence chromosomal instability, tumorigenicity, and patient survival, with smaller tetraploid cells exhibiting greater fitness and tumor-forming potential."
